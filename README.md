## 🧠 Framework Background
### 🏛️ Ghemawat’s AAA Framework

The AAA framework defines three strategic approaches multinational enterprises use to compete internationally:

| Strategy        | Focus                                   | Example (HSBC)                                                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adaptation**  | Local responsiveness                    | Tailored financial products per region (e.g., Islamic Banking, SME financing in Asia) |
| **Aggregation** | Economies of scale & global integration | Unified IT systems, centralized treasury & compliance                                 |
| **Arbitrage**   | Leveraging market differences           | Interest rate spreads, tax, and currency differentials                                |
